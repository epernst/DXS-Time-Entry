# DX365-Time-Entry-App

Extend your Dynamics 365 'Tenerife' with the ability to make time based entries. If you sell your services by the hour, 
then this this app allows you to enter start and end timed. The system will then show the actual duration and calculate the quantity.

You may enter starting and ending time (*1*) directly in the following tables:
- Job Journal Line
- Job Planning Line
- Resource Journal
Additionally the times are transferred to:
- Job Ledger Entry
- Resource Ledger

# Setup

A setup assistant will guide you through the setup.

## Use with hourly units of measure?

The recommended use of the App is to link the time based entries to unit of measure codes marked as hourly. This way you don't accidentially enter a time where you should enter an item quantity. 

# Additional Features

In the job journal a handy factbox gives the user a quick summery of the job he is working on, plus the job journal in total.
