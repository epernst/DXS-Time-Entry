# DX365-Time-Extension

Extend your Dynamics 365 with time based entries. If you sell your services by the hour, 
then this this extension allows you to enter your start and ending time. The system will then show the actual duration and calculate the quantity.

You may enter starting and ending time (*1*) directly in the following tables:
- Job Journal Line
- Job Planning Line
- Resource Journal
Additionally the times are transferred to:
- Job Ledger Entry
- Resource Ledger


# Additional Features

In the job journal a handy factbox gives the user a quick summery of the job he is working on, plus the job journal in total.
